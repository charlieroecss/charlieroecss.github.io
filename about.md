#### Overview
**George Mason University, Fairfax, VA**  
*MA Computational Social Science, May 2019*  
*GPA 3.97*

**James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA**  
*BA Sociology, May 2009*  
*GPA 3.48*

I graduated from [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu) May 18, 2019 with a [Master of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies](https://mais.gmu.edu/programs/la-mais-isin/overview) and a concentration in [computational social science](https://cos.gmu.edu/cds/computational-social-science/).

"Computational Social Science (CSS) is the interdisciplinary science of complex social systems and their investigation through computational modeling and related techniques."

My academic interests tended toward using Agent Based Models (ABM) to simulate complex economic and financial systems such as the causes of financial instability, the formation of economic classes, and the structural effects of equity exchanges.  

ABMs are computational (as opposed to mathematical or analytical) models used to study complex, non-linear systems that have many heterogeneous, adaptive, interacting parts. The methodology has a relatively short history, but that is expected since computational tools are also relatively new (by computational I strictly mean computer-related). As computational power increases, so does the power of ABM.   

I mainly used Python to model complex systems of interest and gather the related data. However, I also used Java and Swift when computational speed and more efficient memory allocation was required. Currently, there are several open source frameworks and free software for ABM for those interested in a little help organizing and deploying models - see the table below:  

Language | Framework | Open Source / Proprietary
-------- | --------- | -------------------------
Python | [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) | Open Source (GitHub)
Python | [ABCE] (https://github.com/AB-CE/abce) | Open Source (GitHub)
NetLogo | [NetLogo](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo) | Open Source (GitHub)
Java | [MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) | Open Source
Java | [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com) | Proprietary with free version





## Interests

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/charlieroecss/charlieroecss.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/charlieroecss/charlieroecss.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
