# Professional experience

**Securities and Exchange Commission - August 2018 to December 2018**  
*Market Researcher - Academic Internship*  

As an intern with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.sec.gov)) in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis ([DERA](https://www.sec.gov/dera)) I was able to dive deep into fine-grained detail of financial data in near real time. I was also able to work with some extremely talented economists and data scientists which helped me formulate my thesis for my master's degree.  

My work included using Python and SQL to extract, clean, and analyze millions of electronic messages sent from traders to exchanges to determine if there were any message patterns being used to exploit price differences at the exchanges by creating processing backlogs. I also researched some theoretical proposals for changing stock pricing from a discrete, $0.01 increment to a continuous price scale. The goal was to determine if any connection existed between the price and volume of a stock and its spread in basis point terms.  

**Eight 32 Group - April 2018 to December 2018**  
*Chief Information Officer*  

Eight 32 Group ([832](https://www.eight32group.com)) is an "enterprise resilience" provider, which means that it helps companies prevent, prepare for, and recover from life-threatening events. When I began working for 832 it was fueled by pure aspiration from the CEO. We were trying to win a contract with a major client to perform emergency response training for their global workforce. My contribution included constructing and managing our client data management strategy as well as migrating the company from an assortment of communication platforms to a unified system to increase security and efficiency. I was also in charge of our cyber security policies and training.

**Accenture Federal Services - May 2012 to August 2018**  
*Systems Engineering Consultant*  

As a systems engineering consultant at Accenture, I helped clients visually understand their business processes so that they could make better decisions about system requirements. I also advised clients on how to implement their requirements based on cost and scope of impact. Often, a client would want to migrate their custom system implementation to a commercial system. During this process I would map out the integration process from the old to the new, which basically meant converting existing business processes into industry standards without losing any functionality.  

I was also fortunate to develop cyber security designs which spanned the entire organization. This involved a long process of identifying attack surfaces and quantifying risk at multiple organizational levels. I helped plan our response to a range of cyber incidents including how to recover to an operational status. 

**The Motley Fool - January 2014 to April 2014**  
*Frelance Writer*  

This was an amazing opportunity to mix my interest in finance with my skill in writing. Being a freelance writer has its pros and cons, but a major benefit was the freedom to choose my topics as long as they were related to long-term investing. That means I could write about a specific company or industry, or just the advantages of long-term investing compared with trying to time the market. You can find my published articles [here](https://www.fool.com/author/12228/index.aspx) if you are interested. I had planned on writing for a long time, but when my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer I put writing to the side, and haven't found the spare time to get back into it.

**Avaya Government Solutions - April 2010 to May 2012**  
*Software Tester*  

This was my first full-time job out of college. I started out just clicking buttons on a screen trying to find bugs in the U.S. Courts' bankruptcy filing software. By the end of my time there I was helping write technical documentation, making small production code updates, and initiated the standardization of the software testing process.
