# Professional experience

**Securities and Exchange Commission - August 2018 to December 2018**  
*Market Researcher - Academic Internship*  

As an intern with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.sec.gov)) in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis ([DERA](https://www.sec.gov/dera)) I was able to dive deep into fine-grained detail of financial data in near real time. I was also able to work with some extremely talented economists and data scientists which helped me formulate my thesis for my master's degree.  

My work included using Python and SQL to extract, clean, and analyze millions of electronic messages sent from traders to exchanges to determine if there were any message patterns being used to exploit price differences at the exchanges by creating processing backlogs. I also researched some theoretical proposals for changing stock pricing from a discrete, $0.01 increment to a continuous price scale. The goal was to determine if any connection existed between the price and volume of a stock and its spread in basis point terms.  

**Eight 32 Group - April 2018 to December 2018**  
*Chief Information Officer*  

Eight 32 Group ([832](https://www.eight32group.com)) is an "enterprise resilience" provider, which means that it helps companies prevent, prepare for, and recover from life-threatening events. When I began working for 832 it was fueled by pure aspiration from the CEO. We were trying to win a contract with a major client to perform emergency response training for their global workforce. My contribution included constructing and managing our client data management strategy as well as migrating the company from an assortment of communication platforms to a unified system to increase security and efficiency. I was also in charge of our cyber security policies and training.

**Accenture Federal Services - May 2012 to August 2018**  
*Systems Engineering Consultant*  

As a systems engineering consultant at Accenture, I helped clients visually understand their business processes so that they could make better decisions about system requirements. I also advised clients on how to implement their requirements based on cost and scope of impact. Often, a client would want to migrate their custom system implementation to a commercial system. During this process I would map out the integration process from the old to the new, which basically meant converting existing business processes into industry standards without losing any functionality.  

I was also fortunate to develop cyber security designs which spanned the entire organization. This involved a long process of identifying attack surfaces and quantifying risk at multiple organizational levels. I helped plan our response to a range of cyber incidents including how to recover to an operational status.
