# About me

# Professional experience

**Securities and Exchange Commission - August 2018 to December 2018**  
*Market Researcher - Academic Internship*  

As an intern with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.sec.gov)) in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis ([DERA](https://www.sec.gov/dera)) I was able to dive deep into fine-grained detail of financial data in near real time. I was also able to work with some extremely talented economists and data scientists which helped me formulate my thesis for my master's degree.  

My work included using Python and SQL to extract, clean, and analyze millions of electronic messages sent from traders to exchanges to determine if there were any message patterns being used to exploit price differences at the exchanges by creating processing backlogs. I also researched some theoretical proposals for changing stock pricing from a discrete, $0.01 increment to a continuous price scale. The goal was to determine if any connection existed between the price and volume of a stock and its spread in basis point terms.  

**Eight 32 Group - April 2018 to December 2018**  
*Chief Information Officer*  

Eight 32 Group ([832](https://www.eight32group.com)) is an "enterprise resilience" provider, which means that it helps companies prevent, prepare for, and recover from life-threatening events. When I began working for 832 it was fueled by pure aspiration from the CEO. We were trying to win a contract with a major client to perform emergency response training for their global workforce. My contribution included constructing and managing our client data management strategy as well as migrating the company from an assortment of communication platforms to a unified system to increase security and efficiency. I was also in charge of our cyber security policies and training.

**Accenture Federal Services - May 2012 to August 2018**  
*Systems Engineering Consultant*

# Education

**George Mason University, Fairfax, VA**  
*MA Computational Social Science, May 2019*  
*GPA 3.97*

**James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA**  
*BA Sociology, May 2009*  
*GPA 3.48*

I graduated from [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu) May 2019 with a [Master of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies](https://mais.gmu.edu/programs/la-mais-isin/overview) and a concentration in [computational social science](https://cos.gmu.edu/cds/computational-social-science/). Someday I may consider pursuing my PhD in CSS or a related field, but I want to refine an idea for a dissertation before going back for more education.

"Computational Social Science (CSS) is the interdisciplinary science of complex social systems and their investigation through computational modeling and related techniques."

My academic interests tended toward using Agent Based Models (ABM) to simulate complex economic and financial systems such as the causes of financial instability, the formation of economic classes, and the structural effects of equity exchanges.  

ABM are computational (as opposed to mathematical or analytical) models used to study complex, non-linear systems that have many heterogeneous, adaptive, interacting parts. The methodology has a relatively short history, but that is expected since computational tools are also relatively new (by computational I strictly mean computer-related). As computational power increases, so does the scope of ABM. However, the power of ABM can be seen in very simple, computationally trivial models, such as [Sugarscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N6D5mMfe0A) or [segregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnffIS2EJ30).  

I mainly used Python to model complex systems of interest and gather the related data. However, I also used Java and Swift when computational speed and more efficient memory allocation was required. Currently, there are several open source frameworks and free software for ABM for those interested in a little help organizing and deploying models - see the table below:  

Language | Framework | Open Source / Proprietary
-------- | --------- | -------------------------
Python | [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) | Open Source (GitHub)
Python | [ABCE](https://github.com/AB-CE/abce) | Open Source (GitHub)
NetLogo | [NetLogo](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo) | Open Source (GitHub)
Java | [MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) | Open Source
Java | [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com) | Proprietary with free version

I am also familiar with social network analysis using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io) package for Python, and statistical analysis using [R](https://www.r-project.org). If you are interested in viewing any of my work, please go to my [Projects](/projects.html) and [Examples](/examples.html) pages.  

My undergraduate education was completed at [James Madison University](https://www.jmu.edu) in 2009 where I earned a BA in Sociology. My research there included critical analysis of deviant behaviors and their associated [medical diagnoses](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/016396201750065009). For example, ADD/ADHD is not consistently diagnosed around the world, and there is still considerable disagreement about it in the U.S.
